TODO shortterm:
- 2022-12-31: when the server is restarted, a different client might get the writign rights! Eventually, the writing ticket is not stored..?

- 2022-08-12: when the client tries to reconnect after the connection was lost, the following error occurs, probably, when the roomCLient tries to connect again, but the roomManager could not yet create the connection: "Connecting to room failed with the following code and message: 3: Connection was closed before the reqeust could be sent." It seems like after this error, the client does nto try again to connect to the roomServer, which is problematic and eventually is the cause for one error in Frauenkappelen with loss of local data. This problem can be stipulated by killing the server and not reloading on the client. 
- 2022-08-01: when the mongo DB tools od not exist (on PATH), the whole server crashes --> make sure only backup/restore fails
- 2022-08-01: for some reason, a meeting (!) that was created previously was gone after a restart! WHY CAN THIS HAPPEN?
- 2022-07-31: create eventGroup (or eventually after some other changes to it; tried to reduce the number of groups, which failed and eventually let the server in a wrong state) --> eventGroup has no round property on the server! (--> and then eventMgr.ejs crashed on first reload of data; but locally it has worked at first.) (restarting the server temporarily solves the problem)
- 2022-02-15: add status-stuff to rBackup (probably the status are currecntly not (always) broadcasted to the client)
- 2021-05-29: creating new meeting with "-" in the shortname results in a DB failure. 

- Meeting-administration: correct unloading (unconnect from the room and so on.)
- when client closes the borwser window, the room should get disconnected regularly, e.g. the writing ticket is returned and other clients could react to it and get writing rights. Currently, other clients just can see that the client with a writing ticket disconnected and can enforce deleting his writing ticket. 
- no callbacks in creating roomClient (i.e. change to async too, if required at all)
- roomClient 682: if data=Errorstring --> Problem

- failure callback respectively status callback in the interval/timeout functions! --> on error, must not only stop the interval, but also call the repsective callbacks and clean the stack!!!



TODO: recheck when failure callback is raised with which error code: how are the different timeouts handled? how usual failures? what happens on connection failure or on timeout after the response was executed? --> hier ist garantiert noch einiges falsch!



TODO: eventually we need to add a function that checks if the connection is closed before trying to use this.sendingFunc() --> we could do this by not assigning the actual sendingFunc to this.sendingFunc, but rather assign it in a proxy function. 


OPTIONAL-TODO:


When is which callback called?:
- in the sendRequest on the caller (in general client):
  - successCB: as soon as the opt.executeAckCount, defined by the responder (server) (!), is reached and thus the response can be executed
  - failureCB: whenever an error occurs (connection OR during processing on the server; can be differentiated by the errCode; attention: this is also raised AFTER success was called, e.g. when a further ack does not arrive and thus timeout is reached (not the interval) OR becasue the connection gets closed meanwhile.. Make sure it is interpreted appropriately by looking at the status and the lastIncomingAckCount)
  - statusCB: whenever ANY response/ack/whatever arrives. The caller must differentiate at what state the . 
  - opt.executeAckCount (defined by the caller/client): has no influence on when (after how many acks) the successCB on itself is executed
  - successCB: (response) =>{}
  - failureCB: (errMsg, errCode, status, lastIncomingAckCount) => {}
  - statusCB: (status, incomingAckCount) => {} 
    - status: 
	  1 = request sent, but execution on responder was not yet started
	  2 = request sent and responder (server) might have started to process the request
	  3 = responder (server) has started to process the request (i.e. at least one ack after opt.executeAckCount has arrived on the caller)
	  4 = response received, not started to process (because of opt.executeAckCount sent from responder (server))
	  5 = response recieved, started to process (or starts now)
  
- when sending the response on the responder/server:
  - there is no successCB, as it is not clear, when success is reached: when the responder sends the ack (or the response itself when executeAckCount=0) that will start the execution on the caller/client and this message is not acknowledged (e.g. because of an interruption in the connection before an ack could be received), the responder/server does not know whether the client has received the execution request. (The same problem appears during sending of the request on the client.) However, the function on the responder/server that has processed the request can decide by itself when success is reached by listening to the statusCB, where the status even indicates the current state. Apart of that there is the failureCB, called whenever the connection fails.  
  - statusCB wird bei jedem eintreffenden Ack ausgelöst. Die übergebene Funktion muss selber filtern, auf welche Ack's es reagieren soll. 
  - statusCB: (status, lastIncomingAckCount)=>{}
    - status:
	  11 = response sent, but execution on caller (client) was not yet started
	  12 = response sent and caller (client) might have started to process the response
	  13 = caller (client) has started to process the response (i.e. at least one ack after opt.executeAckCount has arrived on the responder)
  - failureCB only on connection error OR on timeout (total time, not the interval)
  - failureCB: (errMsg, errCode, status, lastIncomingAckCount) => {}
