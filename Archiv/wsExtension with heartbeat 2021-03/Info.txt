This version already has heartbeats implemented, but still contained the full set of ideas about resending unacknowledged messages and only executing requests and responses as soon as the ack was acked... While the first part is known to work, the latter with acking acks back and forth for a variable amount of times (you can set it!) is untested and probably has some problems. However, the normal acking with request, request-ack, response, response-ack works fine.
