**How to install live Athletics (tested 2021-21)**
- install MariaDB; set max_allowed_packet to 100M or larger; otherwise larger inserts with all performances at a time do not work efficiently. Thus, add the line "max_allowed_packet=500M" in the section [client] in <MariaDB-program folder>\data\my.ini 
- install MongoDB (for debugging, preferrably with "Compass"; there was once an error when installing together with compass. So install MongoDB without compass first and then install compass separately.)
- install Mongo Database Tools (for dump and restore) --> the folder must be added to path!
- install nodejs
- currently: extend the file mariadb/lib/const/collations.js with the following line: defaultCharsets['utf8mb3'] = charsets[33]; // this is needed to make sure that DB restore is working, which otherwise fials because utf8mb3 is not known.
- install the moduleSUI database manually! (--> TODO: make this automatic; when the DB is not available, install it automatically on loading the module)

**How to load files from github**
- checkout "liveAthletics"
- run a command line in the folder
- run "npm install", which will install all dependencies according to package.json
- you should now be ready to run liveathletics: node ./Server.js

- important: always install/update all MongoDb applications at the same time, otherwise problems might occure (and have occured in the past)
