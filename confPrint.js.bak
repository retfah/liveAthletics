     * If a text is too long for the present space, fitting text works as follows:
     * 1. reduce the margin down to maxHorizontalScale*margin (at max)
     * 2. horizontally scale the text down to maxHorizontalScale (at max)
     * 3. if both options did not lead to a fitting text, apply one of four strategies defined by noFitStrategy:
     *    - cut (default): cut the text that does not fit and add a period at the end
     *    - overrun: simply do not care and overrun the available space
     *    - wordWrap: (attention: do not use when the height of the cell is predefined!) does word wrapping between words and at "-". If a single word does not fit the line, then it is automaticaly horizontally scaled to fit. (Margin and font size are not reduced since it would look overly ugly together with the other regular lines.)
     *    - scale: scale the font-size to make it fit.
     * 
     * Options: 
     * - maxMarginScale = ms (default=1)
     * - maxHorizontalScale = hs (default=1)
     * - noFitStrategy = nf: cut (default), overrun, wordWrap, scale (font-size)
