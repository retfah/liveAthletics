2022-10-28: 
vuedraggable.next (for vue 3) so far did not support Swap, which I would need and which I wanted to extend with another sortabljs plugin for "replacement" instead of swap. This plugin, made based on sortablejs 1.14 actually works (in sortable), but would require more changes in draggable. However, there is pullRequest hanging on github to solve the problems with swap (pr153, https://github.com/david-mohr/vue.draggable.next/tree/multidrag). Unfortunately, I'm not able to make this work for me at the moment. Additionally, it does not make any sense to code the "replace"-plugin now, when so many changes in vuedraggable are hanging. 

Thus: implement a replacement plugin as soon as the vuedraggable works with "swap"; then try to adapt those changes for "replace"
So far, do not use vuedraggable between the different areas (unassignedAthletes, series1, series2, ...), but only within one series to sort the lanes. Instead, create my own dragging functionality, which can do swap and replace. This functoin will be based on pure html/js and not use sortable. (With that, it actually does, what sortable does.)
